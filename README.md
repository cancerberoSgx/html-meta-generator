# html-meta-generator

This is a WIP utility to generate configurable HTML metadata for known protocols like known google tags, https://ogp.me/, schema.org. The idea is that you provide name, description, image and this tool generates a snippet you could copy into your page's `<head>`. 

There is a motivation also in learning, teaching, testing, document well known microdata standards. With some luck it could be useful for other than me.

See [notes.md] and [samples/] for some reference to different microdata standards
